A comparison of the files previously available from LocusLink to those now 
   available from Entrez Gene is provided here:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/LL2G.html#files

Files are provided in several directories and subdirectories.  
  This document is comprehensive, and subdivided according to the path in 
  which files are found. 

  Most of the files in this path are re-calculated daily. Gene does not,
  however, compare previous and current data, so the date on the file may 
  change without any change in content.

Changes not affecting use of the ftp site:

gene2accession                                  recalculated daily
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           This file is a comprehensive report of the accessions that are 
           related to a GeneID.  It includes sequences from the international
           sequence collaboration, Swiss-Prot, and RefSeq. The RefSeq subset
           of this file is also available as gene2refseq.

           Because this file is updated daily, the RefSeq subset does not 
           reflect any RefSeq release. Versions of RefSeq RNA and protein 
           records may be more recent than those included in an annotation
           release (build) or those in the current RefSeq release.

           To identify the annotation release/build to which the 
           genomic RefSeqs belong, please refer to the species-specific
           README_CURRENT_RELEASE or README_CURRENT_BUILD
           file in the genomes ftp site:

             ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/
 
           For example:
             ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/README_CURRENT_RELEASE
             ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Ailuropoda_melanoleuca/README_CURRENT_BUILD            

           More notes about this file:

           tab-delimited
           one line per genomic/RNA/protein set of sequence accessions
           Column header line is the first line in the file.

           NOTE: Because this file is comprehensive, it may include
           some RefSeq accessions that are not current, because they are
           part of the annotation of the current genomic assembly. In other 
           words, the annotation of a genome is not continuous, but depends
           on a data freeze. Sub-genomic RefSeqs, however, are updated 
           continuously. Thus some RefSeqs may have been replaced or 
           suppressed after a data freeze assocated with a genomic annotation. 
           Until the release of a new genomic annotation, all
           RefSeqs that are included in the current annotation are reported
           in this file.

gene2ensembl                                    recalculated daily
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           This file reports matches between NCBI and Ensembl annotation
           based on comparison of rna and protein features.

           Matches are collected as follows.
           For a protein to be identified as a match between RefSeq and
           Ensembl, there must be at least 80% overlap between the two.
           Furthermore, splice site matches must meet certain conditions:
           either 60% or more of the splice sites must match, or there may 
           be at most one splice site mismatch.

           For rna features, the best match between RefSeq and Ensembl is 
           selected based on splice site and overlap comparisons. For coding 
           transcripts, there is no minimum threshold for reporting other than 
           the protein comparison criteria above. For non-coding transcripts, 
           the splice site criteria are the same as for protein matching, but 
           the overlap threshold is reduced to 50%.

           Furthermore, both the rna and the protein features must meet these 
           minimum matching criteria to be considered a good match.  In 
           addition, only the best matches will be reported in this file.  
           Other matches that satisified the matching criteria but were
           not the best matches will not be reported in this file.

           A summary report of species that have been compared is contained
           in another FTP file, README_ensembl (see next item).

           Ensembl gene identifiers are also reported in the dbXrefs column
           in the gene_info FTP file.  Due to differences in how these files
           are processed, the Ensembl gene identifiers in these two files
           may not be in complete concordance.

           More notes about this file:

           tab-delimited

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           This file is no longer being updated.  The last update was on
           December 3, 2018.

           This file reports matches between NCBI and Vega annotation.

           Matches are derived from the comparisons between NCBI and
           Ensembl annotation (which are reported in the gene2ensembl FTP
           file).  That is, where there is a match between NCBI and 
           Ensembl annotation, and there is a correspondence between that 
           Ensembl annotation and Vega annotation, then the inferred 
           relationship between the NCBI and Vega annotations are reported 
           here.

           some of the source documents (GeneRIFs, for example) are not

           NOTE: This file is not comprehensive, and contains 
           a subset of information summarizing gene-gene relationships.  

           Relationships are reported symmetrically, where appropriate, and 
           currently include:

               Ortholog*
               Potential readthrough sibling
               Readthrough child
               Readthrough parent
               Readthrough sibling
               Region member
               Region parent
               Related functional gene
               Related pseudogene

           *Note that Ortholog records appear in the gene_orthologs
           file, and are excluded from the gene_group file.
           Note also that the gene_group and gene_orthologs files use the 
           same column format.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tax_id:
           the unique identifier provided by NCBI Taxonomy
           for the species or strain/isolate

GeneID:
           the current unique identifier for a gene

relationship:
           the type of relationship between the two genes, 
           e.g. GeneID has a 'relationship' to Other GeneID

Other tax_id:
           the related gene's tax_id

           report of orthologous genes

           tab-delimited
           one line per pair of GeneIDs
           Column header line is the first line in the file.

           The column format is the same as the gene_group file.  In this 
           file, the relationship column value is always "Ortholog".

           This file does not report relationships symmetrically.  Instead,
           a primary organism/gene is identified for each ortholog, and is
           represented in the first two columns.  All other orthologous
           organisms/genes are represented in the last two columns.  Thus,
           each record in the file represents a pair of orthologous genes.
           If there are N orthologous genes in a group, then there will be
           N-1 records (pairs) represented in the gene_orthologs file.

           Ortholog gene groups are calculated by NCBI's Eukaryotic Genome
           Annotation pipeline for the NCBI Gene dataset using a combination
           of protein sequence similarity and local synteny information.
           Orthologous gene relationships may additionally be assigned after
           manual review by a RefSeq genome curator. Orthology is determined
           between a genome being annotated and a reference genome, typically
           human, and the set of pairwise orthologs are tracked as a group.

           For fish other than zebrafish, orthologs are computed in a
           two-layer process. 1:1 orthologs are computed vs zebrafish, and
           zebrafish orthologs are computed vs human. If the fish gene has a
           zebrafish ortholog that has a human ortholog, then the fish gene
           is combined into the human ortholog group and reported vs the human
           gene. Otherwise it is reported vs the zebrafish gene. To determine
           all fish:zebrafish orthologs for a given tax_id, join the data to
           find the fish:human:zebrafish and fish:zebrafish data.

           in the value part of their identifier.  Consequently,
           dbXrefs for these databases will appear like:
             HGNC:HGNC:1100
             This would be interpreted as database='HGNC', value='HGNC:1100'
           Example for MGI:

             reported by OMIM. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MIM number:
           a MIM number associated with a GeneID
GeneID:
           the current unique identifier for a gene
           the lack of a GeneID, for whatever reason, is represented as a '-'

type:
           type of relationship between the MIM number and the 
           GeneID
              current values are 
                'gene'      the MIM number associated with a Gene, 
                            or a GeneID that is assigned to a record
                            where the molecular basis of the disease
                            is not known
                'phenotype' the MIM number associated with a disease
                            that is associated with a gene

           If NCBI has no record of this MIM number in its databases yet, there is a '-' provided
           in the type column

source:    
           This value is provided only when there is a report of a relationship
           between a MIM number that is a phenotype, and a GeneID.
           The current expected values are GeneMap (from OMIM), GeneReviews, 
           and NCBI.

MedGenCUI: 
           The accession assigned by MedGen to this phenotype.  If the accession starts
           with a C followed by integers, the identifier is a concept ID (CUI) from UMLS.
           https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/
 
           If it starts with a CN, no CUI in UMLS was identified, and NCBI created
           a placeholder. 

Comment:   
           optional value reporting the qualifiers OMIM provides when reporting

ASN_BINARY directory. The file names in this directory are qualified to
distinguish them from the binary ASN.1 files. For example, the gene_info
subset file for human will be found in:

    DATA/GENE_INFO/Mammalia/Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz

The gene_info.gz file will continue to be updated in its original location
in the DATA directory.

The DATA/GENE_INFO/All_Data.gene_info.gz file is identical in content to 
DATA/gene_info.gz even though their file sizes and timestamps may differ
slightly.

VII. Gene-related files from genome annotation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of the genome annotation process, tab-delimited files are created that
give the position of key features in both contig (RefSeq accessions of the 
format NW_ or NT_) and chromosome coordinates, if applicable.

----------------------------------------
GFF files:
----------------------------------------
Start at
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/

and find the genome-specific directories of interest.

There is a GFF directory for each genome, e.g. 

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/GFF/

The most recent annotation is provided for in GFF format for each assembly for that species, 
for both top-level sequences and scaffolds.  

Complete details about NCBI's GFF files are provided in the README file in each 
genome-specific directory.
